# modern-portfolio

This is an amazing modern portfolio template.

I used HTML, CSS, Sass and Javascript to make this project happen.
There is no link for it because I did't deploy it anywhere.

Tips to run and edit:
in the package.json file => scripts: { "sass": "node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css --recursive"
in the terminal => npm run sass
